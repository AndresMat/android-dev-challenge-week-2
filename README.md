# Pomodoro Timer App

![Workflow result](https://github.com/AndresMat/android-dev-challenge-week-2/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
This is a sample Pomodoro timer App; because staying focused at work isn't easy! 

The UI layer is fully built with Jetpack Compose.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
The [first-week](https://github.com/AndresMat/android-dev-challenge-week-1) challenge was exciting and let us know how powerful Compose is. 
For this second week, we have the opportunity to deeply explore concepts like [state](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state) and [animation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation).
